# 1. Print the result of integer dividing (fair division) 15 by 2.
a = 15
b = 2

# print("Fair division:", a // b)  # remainder 1
# print("True division:", a / b)   # 7.5

# 3. Divide 123 by 10, print the quotient (result of true division), and
# then print the remainder.
a = 123
b = 10

# print("True division:", a / b)   # 12.3
# print("Fair division:", a // b)  # 12

# 6. Assign 56 to a variable a and 7 to a variable b. Use these
# variables to perform integer division and print the result.
a = 56
b = 7
# print("True division:", a / b)
# print("Fair division:", a // b)
# print("Modulo op", a % b)

# 9. Without running the code, predict what the following will print:
# print(10 + 20 // 5 % 3)
# print("10 + 1 =", 10 + 20 // 5 % 3)  # I predict the answer to be 11 maybe???....... I was correct!!!!!
# print("1) 20 // 5 =", 20 // 5)
# print("2) 4 % 3 =", 4 % 3)    #
# print("3) 10 + 1 =", 10 + 1)

# 11. You bought a toy for $7.25 and paid with a $10 bill. Calculate
# and print how many dollars and how many cents you should get
# back as change.
# 12. You have 23 apples and want to distribute them evenly to 4
# friends. Calculate and print how many apples each friend gets and
# how many apples are left over.
# 13. In a school, there are 87 students that need to be divided into
# classes of 15. Calculate and print how many full classes can be
# formed and how many students will be left without a class.
# print("I get back: $", 10 - 7.25)
# print("Each friend got", 23 // 4, "apples")  # 3 apples left over
# print("Number of full classes:", 87 // 15)
# print("How many students left without a class:", 87 % 15)

# 14. You are baking cookies and have a recipe that requires 3 eggs per batch. If you have 11
# eggs, calculate and print how many batches of cookies you can make and how many eggs will be left over.
# You can make 3 batches of cookies with 2 eggs left over.
# eggs = 11
# print("Amount of cookie batches", eggs // 3, "and", eggs % 3, "eggs left over")

# 18. You and two friends went out for dinner and the total bill came
# to $85. If you want to split the bill evenly among the three of you,
# calculate and print how much each person should pay.
# 19. You are training for a marathon and ran 153 minutes today.
# Calculate and print how many hours and minutes you ran.

# print("True division:", 85 / 3)
# total_minutes = 153

# print("hours:", total_minutes // 60)
# print("minutes:", total_minutes % 60)
