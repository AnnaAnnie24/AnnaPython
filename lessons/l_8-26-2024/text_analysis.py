Oh, no
See you walking 'round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, girl, why those feet cold?
We just getting started, don't you tiptoe
Tiptoe, ah

Waste time with a masterpiece
Don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me
You should be rolling with me, ah

You're a real-life fantasy
You're a real-life fantasy
But you're moving so carefully
Let's start living dangerously

Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa, oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa, oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

Goddamn
See you licking frosting from your own hands
Want another taste, I'm begging: Yes, ma'am
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land
Dry land, oh

Waste time with a masterpiece
Don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me
You should be rolling with me, ah

You're a real-life fantasy
You're a real-life fantasy
But you're moving so carefully
Let's start living dangerously (whoa)

Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa, oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa, oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (yeah, yeah)

(Oh, ah) I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
(Oh, ah) I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

You're fucking delicious
Talk to me, girl

Talk to me, baby (talk to me, baby)
I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa, oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (hey!)

Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa, oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy (that's right)
I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean, hot damn

Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
Funfetti, I'm ready, I need it every night
Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
